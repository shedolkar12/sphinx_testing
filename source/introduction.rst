Introduction

FNV4 (Fully Networked Vehicle V4): Fully automated framework aims to enable end-to-end model lifecycle from data collection, data transfer to iterative model training, evaluation, and deployment in the vehicle. ​


The objective is to develop a cloud based automated framework to enable different feature owners to onboard a continuous integration/deployment pipeline for individual models with ease. ​

​Motivation:
===============

* Different feature owners develop models for their problem statements and to be able to on-board these models onto vehicles.​

* Current approach deals with end-to-end model-lifecycle from model development to deployment with more human intervention and monitoring which is not as seamless as required​

Standardization:
===================
* If necessart mention some points here.

FNV4 Model dev prerequisites:
================================

FNV4-Feature Integration:
